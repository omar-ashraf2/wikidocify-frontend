# React App Setup and Run Instructions

This document provides instructions to set up and run the React application locally.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- **Node.js** (version 18 or higher recommended)
- **npm** (usually comes with Node.js)
- A code editor like **VS Code** (optional but recommended)
- Git (optional, if cloning the repository)

## Steps to Run the React App

1. **Clone the Repository** (if applicable)  
   If the project is hosted in a Git repository, clone it to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <project-directory>
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**  
   Navigate to the project directory (if not already there) and install the required dependencies using npm:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the Development Server**  
   Start the development server to run the React app locally:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   This will start the app in development mode. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173` (or the port specified in the terminal) to view the app.

4. **Build the App for Production** (Optional)  
   To create an optimized production build:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
   The build output will be in the `dist` folder.

5. **Preview the Production Build** (Optional)  
   To preview the production build locally:
   ```bash
   npm run preview
   ```
   This will serve the production build locally, typically at `http://localhost:4173`.

## Additional Notes
- Ensure you have a stable internet connection during `npm install` to download dependencies.
- If you encounter issues, check the Node.js version (`node -v`) and npm version (`npm -v`) to ensure compatibility.
- For further customization, refer to the project's `package.json` file for additional scripts or configurations.

## Troubleshooting
- **Error: "command not found: npm"**  
  Ensure Node.js and npm are installed. Download Node.js from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org).
- **Port already in use**  
  If the default port (5173) is occupied, you can specify a different port by setting the `PORT` environment variable:
  ```bash
  PORT=3000 npm run dev
  ```

For more help, consult the [React documentation](https://react.dev/) or the [Vite documentation](https://vitejs.dev/) (if the project uses Vite as the build tool).
